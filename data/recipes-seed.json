Add 1 egg and gradually mix in 1/4 to 1/2 cup cold water until a smooth dough forms. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Roll out dough and cut into 5-6 inch circles.\n\nFor the filling: Heat oil in a skillet and sauté finely diced onions until translucent. Add hand-cut beef (or ground beef) and cook until no longer pink, breaking into small pieces. Season with paprika, cumin, chili powder, and oregano. Remove from heat and let cool. Stir in chopped hard-boiled eggs, chopped green onions, and chopped green olives. Chill for at least 1 hour.\n\nAssembly: Place a generous spoonful of filling in the center of each dough disc. Fold over to create a half-moon shape and press edges firmly to seal. Crimp edges decoratively (repulgue). Brush with egg wash. Bake at 450°F (230°C) for 28-30 minutes until golden brown.",

Place thicker cuts like tira de asado (short ribs), vacío (flank steak), and ojo de bife (rib eye) in the center where heat is more intense. Season generously with coarse salt.\n\nFlip the meat occasionally for even cooking. Thicker cuts require 1.5 to 3 hours depending on thickness and desired doneness. Serve the meat as it finishes cooking, accompanied by chimichurri or salsa criolla.\n\nFor chimichurri: Combine 1 cup olive oil, 1 tbsp white wine vinegar, 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, 1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1 tbsp minced garlic, salt, and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.",
